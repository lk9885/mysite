Did you know that modern football began in England in 1863. However, the very earliest form of kicking a ball seems to have originated from a Chinese military manual dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries called Tsu' Chu.

The first world cup was on july 13 1930 and it was held in Uruguay and Uruguay came first overall.
